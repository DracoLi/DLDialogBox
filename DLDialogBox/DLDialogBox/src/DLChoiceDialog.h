/**
 * A DLChoiceDialogCustomizer is used to determine the __look__, __functionalities__,
 * and the __animations__ related to a <DLChoiceDialog>.
 *
 * Every <DLChoiceDialog> must use a dialog customizer. If no customizers are given the
 * dialog box will automatically use the default customizer provided through
 * <defaultCustomizer>.
 *
 * The reason a customizer class is used to store how a dialog box should look,
 * function and animate is because this way you can reuse a single customizer
 * instance on all the DLChoiceDialogs in your game to achieve a consistent look
 * and behaviour.
